The main difference is that ArrayList uses a dynamic array, 
providing fast random access (\(O(1)\) time for get(index)), 
but is slow for insertions/deletions in the middle (\(O(n)\)). 
LinkedList uses a doubly linked list, 
making middle insertions/deletions very fast (\(O(1)\) if you have a reference to the node), 
but slower for random access (\(O(n)\)) 
because it must traverse the list
