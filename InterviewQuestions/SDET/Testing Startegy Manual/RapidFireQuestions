1️⃣ What do you understand about Agile Methodology?

Agile is an iterative development approach where work is delivered in small increments (sprints), allowing continuous feedback, faster releases, and quick adaptation to change.

→ Focuses on collaboration, customer feedback, and incremental delivery.

2️⃣ What are the different types of Performance Testing?

Load Testing → normal user load

Stress Testing → beyond capacity

Spike Testing → sudden increase in load

Endurance/Soak Testing → long duration

Scalability Testing → increasing resource capacity

Volume Testing → heavy data loads

3️⃣ What is Ad-hoc Testing?

Unstructured testing without test cases where testers randomly test the application based on intuition and experience.

→ Useful for finding unexpected defects quickly.

4️⃣ Write 3 negative test cases for a credit card application form.

Enter expired card: → Expect "Card Expired" error

Enter alphanumeric card number: → Expect validation error

Leave CVV blank and submit: → Expect "CVV required"

5️⃣ Regression Testing vs Retesting
Retesting	Regression Testing
Verify fixed defect works	Verify surrounding areas are not broken
Focused on specific bug fix	Checks entire impacted module
Mandatory	Depends on change impact
6️⃣ What is RTM (Requirement Traceability Matrix)?

A document mapping requirements → test cases → defects to ensure complete coverage.

→ Helps confirm nothing is missed.

7️⃣ Entry and Exit Criteria in a Test Plan

Entry Criteria:

Requirements finalized

Test environment ready

Test data prepared

Exit Criteria:

All critical test cases executed

No high-severity bugs open

Test summary/report completed

8️⃣ Black Box Testing Techniques

Equivalence Partitioning

Boundary Value Analysis

Decision Table Testing

State Transition Testing

Error Guessing

Use Case Testing

9️⃣ How do you pass data to Selenium scripts?

Through Excel/CSV (Apache POI)

Properties files / JSON

Database

DataProvider in TestNG

Environment variables

Cucumber Examples/Table

Example (TestNG DataProvider):

@DataProvider
public Object[][] data() {
    return new Object[][]{{"user1","pass1"}, {"user2","pass2"}};
}

🔟 Difference between Agile and Waterfall Model
Agile	Waterfall
Iterative, incremental	Linear, sequential
Changes welcomed	Changes costly
Continuous delivery	Delivery at end
Customer collaboration	Document-driven

1️⃣2️⃣ Regression Testing approach (Manual vs Automation)

Manual:

Run selected regression scenarios manually

Time-consuming, good for small releases

Automation:

Execute regression suite on every release/PR

Faster, repeatable, stable

→ Ideal approach: automate stable, repetitive scenarios + manually test new or UX-heavy flows.

1️⃣3️⃣ If manual takes 10 min and automation also takes 10 min, which do you choose?

Prefer automation.

Why?

Can be reused multiple times

Useful for future sprints & regressions

Can be run in CI/CD

Saves time long-term

Interview sentence:

Even if initial run time is same, 
automation is beneficial in repeated cycles because ROI increases over time.
